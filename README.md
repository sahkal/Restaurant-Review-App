## Description

* Project created as part of the Udacity Front-End Developer Nanodegree.

## Run the Application

In order to run the application you have some options:


 Run it localy
* Download as .zip file or clone this project:

    ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/sahkal/Restaurant-Review-App.git
    ```

* In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer. 

* In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080` (or some other port, if port 8080 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8080`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

* Or simply run the application using git bash [website](https://git-scm.com/downloads) to download and install, then using command http-server run the local server.

* With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8080`.
